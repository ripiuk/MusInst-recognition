              <p>Balalaika is a Russian stringed musical instrument with a characteristic triangular wooden,
                hollow body and three strings. Two strings are usually tuned to the same note and the third string is
                a perfect fourth higher. The higher-pitched balalaikas are used to play melodies and chords.
                The instrument generally has a short sustain, necessitating rapid strumming or plucking when it is
                used to play melodies. Balalaikas are often used for Russian folk music and dancing.</p>
              <p>The balalaika family of instruments includes instruments of various sizes, from the highest-pitched
                to the lowest: the piccolo balalaika, prima balalaika, secunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass
                balalaika, and contrabass balalaika. There are balalaika orchestras which consist solely of different
                balalaikas; these ensembles typically play Classical music that has been arranged for balalaikas.
                The prima balalaika is the most common; the piccolo is rare. There have also been descant and tenor
                balalaikas, but these are considered obsolete. All have three-sided bodies; spruce, evergreen,
                or fir tops; and backs made of three to nine wooden sections (usually maple).
                They are typically strung with three strings, and the necks are fretted.</p>
              <p>The prima balalaika, secunda and alto are played either with the fingers or a plectrum (pick),
                depending on the music being played, and the bass and contrabass (equipped with extension legs
                that rest on the floor) are played with leather plectra. The rare piccolo instrument is usually
                played with a pick.</p>

              <p>Domra is a long-necked Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian folk string instrument of the lute family
                with a round body and three or four metal strings.</p>
              <p>In 1896, a student of Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev found a broken instrument in a stable in rural Russia.
                It was thought that this instrument may have been an example of a domra, although no illustrations or
                examples of the traditional domra were known to exist in Russian chronicles (the traditional domra was
                only known through numerous mentions in folklore, though examples of a related Turkic instrument,
                the dombra, existed). A three-stringed version of this instrument was later redesigned in 1896,
                patented, and introduced into the orchestra of Russian folk instruments.</p>
              <p>The three-stringed domra uses a tuning in 4ths.</p>
              <p>Later, a four-stringed version was developed employing a violin tuning by Moscow instrument maker,
                Liubimov, in 1905.</p>
              <p>In recent times, scholars have come to the conclusion that the term "domra" actually described a
                percussive instrument popular in Russia, and that the discovered instrument was either a variant of
                the balalaika or a mandolin.</p>
              <p>Today, it is the three-stringed domra that is used almost exclusively in Russia. It is played with a
                plectrum, and is often used to play the lead melody in Russian balalaika ensembles.</p>

              <p>The violin, also known informally as a fiddle, is a wooden string instrument in the violin family.
                It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use.
                Smaller violin-type instruments are known, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin,
                but these are virtually unused. The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths,
                and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking
                the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and by using the wooden side of the bow (col legno).</p>
              <p>Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres.
                They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition and in many varieties of folk music.
                They are also frequently used in genres of folk including country music and bluegrass music and in jazz.
                Electric violins are used in some forms of rock music and jazz; further, the violin has come to be
                played in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle
                is often used in reference to folk music, particularly Irish traditional music, and bluegrass,
                but this nickname is also used regardless of the type of music played on it.</p>
              <p>The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the
                18th and 19th centuries. In Europe, it served as the basis for stringed instruments used in western
                classical music, such as the viola.</p>
              <p>Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari,
                Guarneri and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona and by Jacob
                Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to
                explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed.[4][5] Great numbers of instruments have come from
                the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial
                "trade violins" coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt.
                Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears,
                Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers.</p>

              <p>Accordions (from 19th century German Akkordeon, from Akkord—"musical chord, concord of sounds") are a
                family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type, colloquially
                referred to as a squeezebox. A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist.
                The concertina and bandoneón are related; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the
                same family.</p>
              <p>The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys,
                causing pallets to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called reeds.
                These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used
                to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block.[notes 1]
                The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand manual, and the
                accompaniment, consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.</p>
              <p>The accordion is widely spread across the world. In some countries (for example Brazil,
                Colombia and Mexico) it is used in popular music (for example Forró, Sertanejo and B-Pop in Brazil),
                whereas in other regions (such as Europe, North America and other countries in South America) it tends
                to be more used for dance-pop and folk music and as well as in regional and is often used in folk music
                in Europe, North America and South America. Nevertheless, in Europe and North America, some popular
                music acts also make use of the instrument. Additionally, the accordion is also used in cajun, zydeco,
                jazz music and in both solo and orchestra performances of classical music. The piano accordion is the
                official city instrument of San Francisco, California.[4] Many conservatories in Europe have classical
                accordion departments. The oldest name for this group of instruments is harmonika, from the Greek
                harmonikos, meaning harmonic, musical. Today, native versions of the name accordion are more common.
                These names refer to the type of accordion patented by Cyrill Demian, which concerned "automatically
                coupled chords on the bass side".</p>
            {%elif recognized.0.0 == 'bagpipes'%}
              <img src="static/bagpipes.jpg" style="max-height:350px;width:auto;margin-right:10px;" align="left">
              <p>Bagpipes are a wind instrument using enclosed reeds fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of
                a bag. Though the Scottish Great Highland bagpipes are the best known in the Anglophone world,
                bagpipes have been played for a millennium or more throughout large parts of Europe, northern
                Africa, and western Asia, including Turkey, the Caucasus, and around the Persian Gulf.
                The term bagpipe is equally correct in the singular or plural, though pipers usually refer to
                the bagpipes as "the pipes", "a set of pipes" or "a stand of pipes".</p>
              <p>A set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a chanter, and usually at least one
                drone. Many bagpipes have more than one drone (and, sometimes, more than one chanter) in various
                combinations, held in place in stocks—sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag.</p>
              <p>The most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe or blowstick.
                In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling,
                but most blowpipes have a non-return valve that eliminates this need. In recent times, there are
                many instruments that assist in creating a clean air flow to the pipes and assist the collection
                of condensation.</p>
              <p>An innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th century, is the use of a bellows to supply air.
                In these pipes, sometimes called "cauld wind pipes", air is not heated or moistened by the player's
                breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds. Such pipes include the
                Irish uilleann pipes; the Scottish border pipes and Lowland pipes; Northumbrian smallpipes, pastoral
                pipes and English Border pipes in Britain; and the musette de cour in France.</p>
              <p>The bag is an airtight reservoir that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the
                player to maintain continuous even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it
                through a blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely,
                but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows.
                More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including Gore-Tex have become much more common.
                A drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of
                a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of lung infection. An advantage of a
                synthetic bag is that they have a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective moisture trap to
                the inside of the bag.</p>
              <p>Bags cut from larger materials are usually saddle-stitched with an extra strip folded over the seam
                and stitched (for skin bags) or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to
                accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are
                typically tied into the points where limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal,
                a construction technique common in Central Europe.</p>
            {%elif recognized.0.0 == 'bassoon'%}
              <img src="static/bassoon.jpg" style="max-height:350px;width:auto;margin-right:10px;" align="left">
              <p>The bassoon is a woodwind instrument in the double reed family that typically plays music written in
                the bass and tenor clefs, and occasionally the treble. Appearing in its modern form in the 19th century,
                the bassoon figures prominently in orchestral, concert band, and chamber music literature.
                The bassoon is a non-transposing instrument known for its distinctive tone colour, wide range,
                variety of character and agility. Listeners often compare its warm, dark, reedy timbre to that of a
                male baritone voice. Someone who plays the bassoon is called a bassoonist.</p>
              <p>The word bassoon comes from French basson and from Italian bassone (basso with the augmentative
                suffix -one). However, the Italian name for the same instrument is fagotto and in Spanish it is fagot.
                is a Germanic word which means bundle of sticks.</p>
              <p>The bassoon disassembles into six main pieces, including the reed. The bell, extending upward;
                the bass joint (or long joint), connecting the bell and the boot; the boot (or butt), at the bottom of
                the instrument and folding over on itself; the wing joint (or tenor joint), which extends from boot to
                bocal; and the bocal (or crook), a crooked metal tube that attaches the wing joint to a reed
                (About this sound listen (help·info)). Bassoons are double reed instruments like the oboe.</p>
              <p>Folded upon itself, the bassoon stands 1.34 m (4 ft 5 in) tall, but the total sounding length is
                2.54 m (8 ft 4 in). Playing is facilitated by doubling the tube back on itself and by closing the
                distance between the widely spaced holes with a complex system of key work, which extends throughout
                nearly the entire length of the instrument. There are also short-reach bassoons made for the benefit
                of young or petite players.</p>

            <p>A musical instrument is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle,
              any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the
              object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human
              culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success
              on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance
              of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.</p>
            <p>The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object
              that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple flute, dates back as far as 67,000 years.
              Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that
              determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of
              the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical instruments
              were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.</p>
            <p>Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact
              among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their
              origin. By the Middle Ages, instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia, and Europeans
              played instruments from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures
              of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. By 1400, musical instrument development
              slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident.</p>
            <p>Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification
              have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material
              composition, their size, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses the means
              by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.</p>
