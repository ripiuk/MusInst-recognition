              <p>Balalaika is a Russian stringed musical instrument with a characteristic triangular wooden,
                hollow body and three strings. Two strings are usually tuned to the same note and the third string is
                a perfect fourth higher. The higher-pitched balalaikas are used to play melodies and chords.
                The instrument generally has a short sustain, necessitating rapid strumming or plucking when it is
                used to play melodies. Balalaikas are often used for Russian folk music and dancing.</p>
              <p>The balalaika family of instruments includes instruments of various sizes, from the highest-pitched
                to the lowest: the piccolo balalaika, prima balalaika, secunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass
                balalaika, and contrabass balalaika. There are balalaika orchestras which consist solely of different
                balalaikas; these ensembles typically play Classical music that has been arranged for balalaikas.
                The prima balalaika is the most common; the piccolo is rare. There have also been descant and tenor
                balalaikas, but these are considered obsolete. All have three-sided bodies; spruce, evergreen,
                or fir tops; and backs made of three to nine wooden sections (usually maple).
                They are typically strung with three strings, and the necks are fretted.</p>
              <p>The prima balalaika, secunda and alto are played either with the fingers or a plectrum (pick),
                depending on the music being played, and the bass and contrabass (equipped with extension legs
                that rest on the floor) are played with leather plectra. The rare piccolo instrument is usually
                played with a pick.</p>

              <p>Domra is a long-necked Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian folk string instrument of the lute family
                with a round body and three or four metal strings.</p>
              <p>In 1896, a student of Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev found a broken instrument in a stable in rural Russia.
                It was thought that this instrument may have been an example of a domra, although no illustrations or
                examples of the traditional domra were known to exist in Russian chronicles (the traditional domra was
                only known through numerous mentions in folklore, though examples of a related Turkic instrument,
                the dombra, existed). A three-stringed version of this instrument was later redesigned in 1896,
                patented, and introduced into the orchestra of Russian folk instruments.</p>
              <p>The three-stringed domra uses a tuning in 4ths.</p>
              <p>Later, a four-stringed version was developed employing a violin tuning by Moscow instrument maker,
                Liubimov, in 1905.</p>
              <p>In recent times, scholars have come to the conclusion that the term "domra" actually described a
                percussive instrument popular in Russia, and that the discovered instrument was either a variant of
                the balalaika or a mandolin.</p>
              <p>Today, it is the three-stringed domra that is used almost exclusively in Russia. It is played with a
                plectrum, and is often used to play the lead melody in Russian balalaika ensembles.</p>

              <p>The violin, also known informally as a fiddle, is a wooden string instrument in the violin family.
                It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use.
                Smaller violin-type instruments are known, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin,
                but these are virtually unused. The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths,
                and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking
                the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and by using the wooden side of the bow (col legno).</p>
              <p>Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres.
                They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition and in many varieties of folk music.
                They are also frequently used in genres of folk including country music and bluegrass music and in jazz.
                Electric violins are used in some forms of rock music and jazz; further, the violin has come to be
                played in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle
                is often used in reference to folk music, particularly Irish traditional music, and bluegrass,
                but this nickname is also used regardless of the type of music played on it.</p>
              <p>The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the
                18th and 19th centuries. In Europe, it served as the basis for stringed instruments used in western
                classical music, such as the viola.</p>
              <p>Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari,
                Guarneri and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona and by Jacob
                Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to
                explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed.[4][5] Great numbers of instruments have come from
                the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial
                "trade violins" coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt.
                Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears,
                Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers.</p>

            <p>A musical instrument is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle,
              any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrumentâ€”it is through purpose that the
              object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human
              culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success
              on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance
              of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.</p>
            <p>The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object
              that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple flute, dates back as far as 67,000 years.
              Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that
              determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of
              the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical instruments
              were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.</p>
            <p>Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact
              among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their
              origin. By the Middle Ages, instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia, and Europeans
              played instruments from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures
              of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. By 1400, musical instrument development
              slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident.</p>
            <p>Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification
              have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material
              composition, their size, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses the means
              by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.</p>
